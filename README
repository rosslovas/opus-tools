== Opus Audio Tools ==

This is opus-tools, a set of tools to encode, inspect, and decode
audio in the Opus format.

For more information on Opus see http://www.opus-codec.org/


This fork adds --force-gain and --no-encoder-comments to opusenc.
force-gain allows you to specify the gain in the header of the output file.
no-encoder-comments prevents ENCODER and ENCODER_OPTIONS comments
from being written to the output file.
